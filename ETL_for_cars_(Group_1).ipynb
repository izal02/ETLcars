            "Review: I saved up my money and bought a 2010 mustang v6 premium as my first car in November of 2019. I am thoroughly pleased with it. It’s 4.0 liter v6 gives a decent amount of power for what it is, but it’s mostly the curb weight that can be attributed for its power. The engine layout changes in 2011 and frankly is improved, but the 2010 layout is easily open for modifications and the oil pan and other necessities are easy to access. I have an automatic transmission and it rides very smoothly. I live in the country so I have to deal with rough country roads all of the time and it gives no trouble. The factory suspension is stiff, but that’s to be expected and still gives a great ride. The interior is artfully crafted and I especially enjoy changing the color of the cabin lighting. The back seat is more comfortable than some, i.e. a 2004 Audi A4 Quattro, but is not especially spacious in comparison to all kinds of other vehicles. When compared only to two door coupes though, the back seat is decent. The front seats are very comfortable and the stereo system is superb. As for handling the steering is slightly loose, but overall for an entry level car is a great bang for its buck. As for ice and snow, I personally have no problem handling it, but it naturally has the tendency to slip because it’s a rear wheel drive car. The engine is definitely no match for the gt but it gives enough power to be fun and economical. I average 21 mpg which is decent for a rear wheel drive coupe. Overall I think it’s an amazing car for the money and would definitely recommend it to anyone.\n",

Plenty of power.  I have an 89 GT convertible, and this one is light years ahead of the older fox bodies that opened the new muscle car era...\n",

Don’t listen to people saying it’s not a 5.0 325 torch is plenty, such a fun car best sounding motor is the 4.6 and super reliable, the exterior is old and new school combined! Best looking and best overall car for the money, best bang for buck! I test drove a 2013 gt but wasn’t worth the extra money! 2010s are steals!!\n",

            "Review: I bought my first Mustang back in 1980 when I left for college.  A '72 302 V8.  A lifelong Mustang lover, I've always talked about buying another one, but for family and job reasons have always bought SUV's and pickups.  39 years later, I decided to add a Mustang to the fleet for fun.  After lots of shopping and comparing models, I decided on a 2010 V6 Premium.  This one had low mileage, good price and a clean history.  I really like the looks of this model also.  I love this car!  Comfortable,  responsive... There are hundreds of opinions 4.0 liter versus the 3.7 which came out in 2011.   I was well aware of all that before buying, I made an educated decision and I've got no regrets.  I had considered an 8 cylinder, but went with the 6..  I don't need a rocket, just something fun to drive.  The 4.0 has plenty of pickup, it quickly (and smoothly) hit 105 mph the other night on the tollway before I even realized it... there was plenty more room to go faster but I don't need a ticket.  Nice to know the zip is there if I need it.  This car just feels right... I've driven several Stangs over the years, and I'm really happy to own this one.\n",

            "- what can i say... it was a 4.0 with a 5speed. not the fastest thing in the world but I will say if you wanted a reliable cheap sports car this is the way to go. The 4.0 is a solid engine and in this car it provides.... adequate power. Only above 60 did you really notice the lack of power from the motor. Steering and handling however were this cars strong suits and it held the road very nicely with some great all-season tires.\n",

            "Exterior Styling\n",
            "- looks from the outside were very good. Everything on the car was standard halogen with no fog lights so driving at night was a little dissapointing. everything seemed to fit the car nicely and balance out with 17\" rims and the standard body kit. Nothing fancy but the color was very nice and popped great on a sunny day.\n",

            "Interior\n",
            "- This was a base model \"rental\" style car and it let you know. sound was sub par and the cabin was minimally insulated leaving you alot to be desired. On the upside everything was very well thought out and it had super intuitive controls that were logical and well laid out. Driving in sub zero temps left everything but the front and rear window fogged up but with a good set of tires you could drive in up to 6\" of snow in a blizzard.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall impressions\n",
            "- for a very base model vehicle it was very nice. There are lots of better choices with more options but wanting to start out in something simple this is a practical choice. If you're looking for something to buy for your kids first car this is right up there... not going to get them made fun of but also very safe and you know they won't be racing everywhere.\n",

            "Review: I think this car is the best car I have ever owned, hands down. It looks sporty, drives like a dream, and is an eye catcher since it was remodeled for the S197 2010 and up years. The beauty that comes with this car is not only on the outside, but under the hood, since parts wear down over time. Luckily for you, mustang parts are a dime a dozen and appear everywhere for a low price since  it is still a ford, although it isn't badged as one. Love it!\n",

The stock exhaust is awesome sounding and the performance is still great, even with the smaller engine.  Many may complain about the solid rear axle, but this is a very tossable car and is more fun than most IRS muscle cars.  The inside is a little spartan but still has the basic creature comforts expected in modern vehicles.  This is my first choice for a weekend car when the weather is nice.\n",

I do miss power seats and some of the creature comforts I had on my last car and would have had, if I'd held out for a Mustang Premium. The worst surprise? The car lacks Bluetooth and Satellite Radio. It's like you can't even activate the radio... It doesn't exist. The \"phone\" and \"satellite\" buttons do nothing, even though they're on the center stack to taunt you. Your options are $450 for a Ford upgade to the radio (basically adding Sync), or replacing the radio with a new touch-screen unit and adding the hardware necessary for installation (probably $700-$100). Otherwise, the car is still a sexy beast. A Mustang in any configuraton is a head-turner and a ball to drive.\n",

The trunk latch was messed up when we bought it but with the extended warranty it was fixed and worked just fine. The handling and acceleration is amazing compared to the other modern muscle cars on the road, and the gas mileage is slightly better too.

It also lacked that wonderful sound of hp from the exhaust. I tried the Mustang and loved it, for 315 hp she still gets squirrely. My only complaint is those darn headrests, what was Ford thinking? I felt like I had to drive with my neck bent, if I reclined my seat then it became a strech for my arms. My friends 2012 Focus has the same headrests too. Good thing is you can purchase a nice set that look factory right down to the leather grain. Now the car is perfect.\n",

Better cornering, fast turn in, good rotation in corners, not at all much understeer unless you REALLY overcook the corner. Engine: Much more torque, and that top end power, whowzie. Better visibility, more gadgets (got the big Touchscreen SYNC) .. Awesome looks. I got a Grabber blue with white stripe package. Stock tires REALLY need heat to get good grip. Easily fixed if needed.

This is an extra car, so going the used route made sense. I am extremely happy with the vehicle. It drives really well - tight in turns, great acceleration. The 5 speed transmission is smooth and reacts well. The interior ergonomics and creature comforts are tremendous (Leather, Climate control, heated seats, etc). I have the factory navigation with sync and am still learning all that it can do. The convertible option is great given I can use it almost year round in NC.\n",

Leather seats add a level of luxury, without spending a ton of money. The only drawback is the less than average gas mileage (25mpg HWY, I would expect a little better with a V6), however, I did not base my purchase on the mpg. I bought this car because I am no longer a soccer-mom, and I don't have to cart kids and all their gear around town anymore. Ladies - I highly recommend - it's a big ego boost as well.\n",

This cars quality and refinement for the dollar is a true testiment to how things have changed at Ford for the better. Fit and finish and materials are above par for the Mustang compared to the Camaro and Chanllenger. Trust me I have driven both, and despite the fact the Camaro has must more power than the 10 Mustang its refinement is years off compared to the pony car. I love the fact that its easy to see out of the Mustang with not blind spot concerns and what a fabulous turning diameter. Try doing a short turn around in the Camaro or Challenger. Overall very pleased so far in my drive with the stang. Next time the GT for sure!\n",

This car has gotten me back into American cars. The 2010 Mustang's fit and finish is an awesome improvement over previous years. The styling harkens back to the 60's but in a modern format. Even though the 2010 has the 4.6 L V-8 (the 2011 has the 5.0 412 RWHP V-8) it is actually enough for me. There is nothing better than putting the top down and crusing.

            "Ford's new 2011 Mustang is better with the new engine. But 2010 ushered in the retro 1969-1970 curves of the past. The inside is not a Mercedes, but much better than a Charger, Challenger, and Camaro. You can fit four adults some-what comfortably inside compared to past years. There is increased legroom for the driver in comparison to the 5th generation 2005-2009.\n",

The SYNC system offers many audio features not found on the competition. While 19\" wheels are the standard with the GT, 20\" will offer more of a choice in tires & after market wheels. All in all, a great every day driver that gets plenty of complements where ever I go. Makes me feel 16 again!!\n",

            "Review: I was in the market for a new convertible. I was ready to trade up from my 2000 Cavalier. The only requirement I had was that the new car be red w/a black top. I looked at insurance & cost for the Beetle, EOS, Mini, Sebring, and Mustang. Car buying for me is a spritual experience and for me its clear when you find \"the one\". The Sebring didnt offer the shade of red I wanted (think Fire Engine). I found a Mustang locally but it was black on black. Then I found \"the one\", a beautiful candy apple red mustang V6 convertible. As of today, I truly do love everything about it. I have never before been a \"Mustang Person\", but I think I may have just converted! GIDDY UP!\n",

Unlike the older GT500's that felt heavy in the nose and needed \"pushing\" around corners, Ford's new GT500 transfers the weight during cornering very well. They've taken a heavy muscle car and made it seem hundreds of pounds less. The braking system is more than powerful enough to stop the weight and horsepower of this beast. Along with all the factory improvements quality aftermarket parts are everywhere for these modern day muscle cars. The possiblities are endless, from the twisties to the drag strip.\n",

My 2010 Mustang GT with the Pirelli's 19's inch wheel/tire combo has no impact harsness to the ride whatsover! NONE!

            "Review: I saved up my money and bought a 2010 mustang v6 premium as my first car in November of 2019. I am thoroughly pleased with it. It’s 4.0 liter v6 gives a decent amount of power for what it is, but it’s mostly the curb weight that can be attributed for its power. The engine layout changes in 2011 and frankly is improved, but the 2010 layout is easily open for modifications and the oil pan and other necessities are easy to access. I have an automatic transmission and it rides very smoothly. I live in the country so I have to deal with rough country roads all of the time and it gives no trouble. The factory suspension is stiff, but that’s to be expected and still gives a great ride. The interior is artfully crafted and I especially enjoy changing the color of the cabin lighting. The back seat is more comfortable than some, i.e. a 2004 Audi A4 Quattro, but is not especially spacious in comparison to all kinds of other vehicles. When compared only to two door coupes though, the back seat is decent. The front seats are very comfortable and the stereo system is superb. As for handling the steering is slightly loose, but overall for an entry level car is a great bang for its buck. As for ice and snow, I personally have no problem handling it, but it naturally has the tendency to slip because it’s a rear wheel drive car. The engine is definitely no match for the gt but it gives enough power to be fun and economical. I average 21 mpg which is decent for a rear wheel drive coupe. Overall I think it’s an amazing car for the money and would definitely recommend it to anyone.\n",

            "Review: I bought my first Mustang back in 1980 when I left for college.  A '72 302 V8.  A lifelong Mustang lover, I've always talked about buying another one, but for family and job reasons have always bought SUV's and pickups.  39 years later, I decided to add a Mustang to the fleet for fun.  After lots of shopping and comparing models, I decided on a 2010 V6 Premium.  This one had low mileage, good price and a clean history.  I really like the looks of this model also.  I love this car!  Comfortable,  responsive... There are hundreds of opinions 4.0 liter versus the 3.7 which came out in 2011.   I was well aware of all that before buying, I made an educated decision and I've got no regrets.  I had considered an 8 cylinder, but went with the 6..  I don't need a rocket, just something fun to drive.  The 4.0 has plenty of pickup, it quickly (and smoothly) hit 105 mph the other night on the tollway before I even realized it... there was plenty more room to go faster but I don't need a ticket.  Nice to know the zip is there if I need it.  This car just feels right... I've driven several Stangs over the years, and I'm really happy to own this one.\n",

Driving in sub zero temps left everything but the front and rear window fogged up but with a good set of tires you could drive in up to 6\" of snow in a blizzard.\n",

The beauty that comes with this car is not only on the outside, but under the hood, since parts wear down over time. Luckily for you, mustang parts are a dime a dozen and appear everywhere for a low price since  it is still a ford, although it isn't badged as one. Love it!\n",

The stock exhaust is awesome sounding and the performance is still great, even with the smaller engine.  Many may complain about the solid rear axle, but this is a very tossable car and is more fun than most IRS muscle cars.  The inside is a little spartan but still has the basic creature comforts expected in modern vehicles.  This is my first choice for a weekend car when the weather is nice.\n",

I do miss power seats and some of the creature comforts I had on my last car and would have had, if I'd held out for a Mustang Premium. The worst surprise? The car lacks Bluetooth and Satellite Radio. It's like you can't even activate the radio... It doesn't exist. The \"phone\" and \"satellite\" buttons do nothing, even though they're on the center stack to taunt you. Your options are $450 for a Ford upgade to the radio (basically adding Sync), or replacing the radio with a new touch-screen unit and adding the hardware necessary for installation (probably $700-$100). Otherwise, the car is still a sexy beast. A Mustang in any configuraton is a head-turner and a ball to drive.\n",

The trunk latch was messed up when we bought it but with the extended warranty it was fixed and worked just fine.

It also lacked that wonderful sound of hp from the exhaust. I tried the Mustang and loved it, for 315 hp she still gets squirrely. My only complaint is those darn headrests, what was Ford thinking? I felt like I had to drive with my neck bent, if I reclined my seat then it became a strech for my arms. My friends 2012 Focus has the same headrests too. Good thing is you can purchase a nice set that look factory right down to the leather grain. Now the car is perfect.\n",

The V6 has plenty of power and I'm getting 24 mpg. It has a nice throaty muscle car rumble too, but rides smoother and much quieter than I imagined it would. The handling is superb, it's beautiful inside and out and virtually showroom new with 27,000 miles at purchase. there are absolutely no issues! Purchasing a certified Pre-Owned car is the way to go.\n",

The 5 speed transmission is smooth and reacts well. The interior ergonomics and creature comforts are tremendous (Leather, Climate control, heated seats, etc).

Leather seats add a level of luxury, without spending a ton of money.

Fit and finish and materials are above par for the Mustang compared to the Camaro and Chanllenger. Trust me I have driven both, and despite the fact the Camaro has must more power than the 10 Mustang its refinement is years off compared to the pony car. I love the fact that its easy to see out of the Mustang with not blind spot concerns and what a fabulous turning diameter. Try doing a short turn around in the Camaro or Challenger.

When I get home park it in the garage and get out.... I still say \"wow\". This car has me under its wrath. And I love it. Looking forward to fixing it up.

            "Review: My 2010 Mustang GT Convertable is an outstanding car. After years of owning Japanese cars including a Mazada Miata and a Honda Ridgeline. This car has gotten me back into American cars. The 2010 Mustang's fit and finish is an awesome improvement over previous years. The styling harkens back to the 60's but in a modern format. Even though the 2010 has the 4.6 L V-8 (the 2011 has the 5.0 412 RWHP V-8) it is actually enough for me. There is nothing better than putting the top down and crusing. Since I live in New York, I plan on driving the car all year. The traction control will help in the snow, but then alot of us grew up with rear wheel drive and survived many a winter storm.\n",

I looked at insurance & cost for the Beetle, EOS, Mini, Sebring, and Mustang. Car buying for me is a spritual experience and for me its clear when you find \"the one\". The Sebring didnt offer the shade of red I wanted (think Fire Engine). I found a Mustang locally but it was black on black. Then I found \"the one\", a beautiful candy apple red mustang V6 convertible. As of today, I truly do love everything about it.

They've taken a heavy muscle car and made it seem hundreds of pounds less. The braking system is more than powerful enough to stop the weight and horsepower of this beast. Along with all the factory improvements quality aftermarket parts are everywhere for these modern day muscle cars. The possiblities are endless, from the twisties to the drag strip.\n",

            "Review: I am currently driving the 2010 Mustang GT and it is right on! From exclusive lighting, shaker sound system, throaty exhaust and just raw performance! Ford also exceeds with the Sync system making it possible for vehicle health reports, and plugging in a USB for all your music not to mention many other options. The rear sequential blinker lights remind me of a great white shark...just like Ford say's \"DRIVE ONE!\"\n",

            "Review: I own a mustang now, and with the economy, I started looking at the camaro. After looking at it, I decided I could settle, but I knew what I was supposed to stick with. My Mustang has NEVER given me a minute's problem. And, after test driving and making me decision, that's the path I'm sticking to; the one I know is reliable! Inside and out, the car is amazing. It handles like the mustang always has, and the sound is above and beyond. The seats \"hold\" you, and you feel very \"comforted.\" there's no comparison for me, the mustang is MY only sports car! You won't regret it.\n",

            "Review: Maybe it's because I traded out of an 05 F150 Lariat ... maybe it's because I felt the 05-09 Mustang GT's were too stiff riding ... too loud and too crash with a chintzy interior .... maybe it's because I am turning 50 this year ... who knows but what I can tell you is this is the best, by far, Mustang (and perhaps the best Ford) ever produced! My 2010 Mustang GT with the Pirelli's 19's inch wheel/tire combo has no impact harsness to the ride whatsover! NONE! And yet she stays glued to the road ... the interior redo tops many many other cars upgraded interiors and I have had many many others cars .... everything about this car screams quality ... there is an allure to driving her that is addictive ... Forget the Challenger (too too heavy and ponderous to drive) and the Camaro (as usual there is a cheapness to the feel of it like its many predecessors) .... I will stop talking and tell you that Ford is RIGHT! DRIVE ONE and you will see! Enjoy\n",

            "Review: i saved up my money and bought a 2010 mustang v6 premium as my first car in november of 2019. i am thoroughly pleased with it. it is 4.0 liter v6 gives a decent amount of power for what it is, but it is mostly the curb weight that can be attributed for its power. the engine layout changes in 2011 and frankly is improved, but the 2010 layout is easily open for modifications and the oil pan and other necessities are easy to access. i have an automatic transmission and it rides very smoothly. i live in the country so i have to deal with rough country roads all of the time and it gives no trouble. the factory suspension is stiff, but that is to be expected and still gives a great ride. the interior is artfully crafted and i especially enjoy changing the color of the cabin lighting. the back seat is more comfortable than some, i.e. a 2004 audi a4 quattro, but is not especially spacious in comparison to all kinds of other vehicles. when compared only to two door coupes though, the back seat is decent. the front seats are very comfortable and the stereo system is superb. as for handling the steering is slightly loose, but overall for an entry level car is a great bang for its buck. as for ice and snow, i personally have no problem handling it, but it naturally has the tendency to slip because it is a rear wheel drive car. the engine is definitely no match for the gt but it gives enough power to be fun and economical. i average 21 mpg which is decent for a rear wheel drive coupe. overall i think it is an amazing car for the money and would definitely recommend it to anyone.\n",

            "Review: i bought my first mustang back in 1980 when i left for college.  a '72 302 v8.  a lifelong mustang lover, i have always talked about buying another one, but for family and job reasons have always bought suv's and pickups.  39 years later, i decided to add a mustang to the fleet for fun.  after lots of shopping and comparing models, i decided on a 2010 v6 premium.  this one had low mileage, good price and a clean history.  i really like the looks of this model also.  i love this car!  comfortable,  responsive... there are hundreds of opinions 4.0 liter versus the 3.7 which came out in 2011.   i was well aware of all that before buying, i made an educated decision and i have got no regrets.  i had considered an 8 cylinder, but went with the 6..  i do not need a rocket, just something fun to drive.  the 4.0 has plenty of pickup, it quickly (and smoothly) hit 105 mph the other night on the tollway before i even realized it... there was plenty more room to go faster but i do not need a ticket.  nice to know the zip is there if i need it.  this car just feels right... i have driven several stangs over the years, and i am really happy to own this one.\n",
